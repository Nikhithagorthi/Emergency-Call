AI-Assisted Emergency Police Call System: Enhancing Emergency Response with AI Problem Overview: In emergency situations, victims often struggle to convey their distress effectively, leading to delays in police response. Miscommunication, officer unavailability, or the lack of precise location details can be life-threatening. A solution is needed to bridge this gap and ensure a faster, more efficient emergency response system.

Proposed Solution: AI-Assisted Emergency Police Call System This system integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assist emergency calls, analyze distress levels, and automatically relay critical information to the nearest police station.

Key Features & Functionality AI-Powered Call Assistance:

If police officers are unavailable, an AI-powered virtual assistant answers emergency calls. The AI assistant engages with the caller, asking relevant questions to extract critical details. It ensures that even in situations where human operators are overloaded, emergency calls are never ignored. Sentiment Analysis & Voice Recognition:

AI-driven sentiment analysis processes the caller's tone, speech patterns, and emotions to detect distress levels. Voice recognition technology enables communication in multiple languages and dialects, making the system accessible to diverse populations. Automated Location Tracking & Alert System:

The AI system retrieves the caller’s location using GPS tracking. If distress is detected, the system immediately forwards the caller’s location, distress level, and other details to the nearest police station. Police Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring:

A dedicated dashboard displays incoming emergency calls, prioritizing cases based on urgency. Officers can monitor real-time data, including caller information, distress analysis, and location tracking, enabling them to take immediate action.
